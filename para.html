    <h1>Call Of Duty: Warzone</h1>
    <p>Call of Duty: Warzone is a free-to-play battle royale video game released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4,
        Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. A version for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S has been announced to be
        released in 2022, with a mobile version also in development as of 2022.[1][2] The game is a part of 2019's Call
        of Duty: Modern Warfare and is connected to 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War, 2021's Call of Duty:
        Vanguard and the sequel of Modern Warfare coming in 2022 (but does not require purchase of either titles) and
        was introduced during Season 2 of Modern Warfare content. Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward and Raven
        Software (the latter later credited as the sole developer following the integration of Cold War's content) and
        published by Activision.[3] Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players, although some
        limited-time game modes support 200 players. Other modes include Plunder, Rebirth: Resurgence, Buy Back, Payload
        and Clash. The game features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between three games.</p>

    <H2>Game modes</H2>
    <p>Warzone is the second main battle royale installment in the Call of Duty franchise, following the "Blackout" mode
        of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018). Warzone differs from Black Ops 4 by reducing reliance on equipable gadgets
        and instead encouraging the accumulation of a new in-game currency called Cash.[7] Warzone features two primary
        game modes: Battle Royale and Plunder,.[7] It supports up to 150 players in a single match, which exceeds the
        typical size of 100 players seen in other battle royale titles.[8] Some limited-time modes support 200 players.

    <!--Continuing the same process header continues to get smaller-->
    <h3>Rebirth Island</h3>
    <p>Rebirth Island is the second map introduced in the game with the integration of Black Ops Cold War's contents.
        The map is based on the real-life Vozrozhdeniya Island, which was also featured in the Call of Duty: Black Ops
        campaign mode. Design-wise, the map is a re-imagination of "Alcatraz Island", previously featured in Black Ops
        4's Blackout mode. Unlike Verdansk, Rebirth Island is smaller in scale, only allowing 40 players maximum per
        match.</p>

    <h4>Equipment</h4>
    <p>In Battle Royale modes and Rebirth modes, every player starts out with a basic un-customized pistol. Players can
        pick up every component found in a standard loadout (primary and secondary weapons, lethal and tactical
        equipment, field upgrades, and kill streaks) as they search the map for items scattered across the ground and
        from supply boxes found in designated locations. Additional equipment unique to Warzone are armor plates. Three
        of these armor plates can be equipped to a player at a given time with the ability to carry up to five plates in
        the players' inventory, or up to eight if the player has found an armor satchel. Players can also pick up cash
        that can be used at buy stations to purchase various killstreaks or support items. Custom weapon loadouts can be
        acquired from loadout crates. These loadout crates appear periodically throughout a match and can also be
        purchased from buy stations. In Plunder, players spawn with custom loadouts, similar to regular Multiplayer
        modes.
