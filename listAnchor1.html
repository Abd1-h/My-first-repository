            <li>Washington</li>
            <ul>
                <li>the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the Western United States.
                    Named for George Washington—the first U.S. president—the state was formed from the western part of
                    the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the
                    Oregon Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state, which is bordered on the
                    west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of
                    British Columbia to the north—was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the
                    state capital; the state's largest city is Seattle. Washington is often referred to as Washington
                    state to distinguish it from the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.[4][5]</li>

            <li>California</li>
            <ul>
                <li>California is a state in the Western United States. California borders Oregon to the north, Nevada
                    and Arizona to the east, the Mexican state of Baja California to the south; and has a coastline
                    along the Pacific Ocean to the west. With over 39.5 million residents across a total area of
                    approximately 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2), it is the most populous and the third-largest U.S.
                    state by area. It is also the most populated subnational entity in North America and the 34th most
                    populous in the world. The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's
                    second and fifth most populous urban regions respectively, with the former having more than 18.7
                    million residents and the latter having over 9.6 million.[13] Sacramento is the state's capital,
                    while Los Angeles is the most populous city in the state and the second most populous city in the
                    country (after New York City). Los Angeles County is the country's most populous, while San
                    Bernardino County is the largest county by area in the country (Alaska has some larger subdivisions,
                    but they are not called counties). San Francisco, which is both a city and a county, is the second
                    most densely populated major city in the country (after New York City) and the fifth most densely
                    populated county in the country, behind four of New York City's five boroughs.</li>

                    Utah (/ˈjuːtɑː/ YOO-tah, /ˈjuːtɔː/ (audio speaker iconlisten) YOO-taw) is a state in the Mountain
                    West subregion of the Western United States. Utah is a landlocked U.S. state bordered to its east by
                    Colorado, to its northeast by Wyoming, to its north by Idaho, to its south by Arizona, and to its
                    west by Nevada. Utah also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. Of the fifty U.S. states,
                    Utah is the 13th-largest by area; with a population over three million, it is the 30th-most-populous
                    and 11th-least-densely populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two areas: the Wasatch
                    Front in the north-central part of the state, which is home to roughly two-thirds of the population
                    and includes the capital city, Salt Lake City; and Washington County in the southwest, with more
                    than 180,000 residents.[9] Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin.

                <li>
                    New York is a state in the Northeastern United States. It is sometimes called New York State to
                    distinguish it from its largest city, New York City. With a total area of 54,556 square miles
                    (141,300 km2),[2] New York is the 27th largest state geographically. With 20.2 million residents, it
                    is the fourth most populous state in the United States as of 2021, with approximately 44% living in
                    New York City and another 14% on the remainder of Long Island.[6][9][10][11] The state is bordered
                    by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the south, and Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont to the
                    east; it has a maritime border with Rhode Island, east of Long Island, as well as an international
                    border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the northwest.
